 Cryptocurrency monitoring via websockets, implemented on RTK Query

Briefly about the project: web-application for cryptocurrencies monitoring via web-sockets, using API Binance. CoinGecko API was used for logos, unfortunely i couldn't find API that can share real-time update prices and logos, for this reason was used coinGecko 3.6MB logos list of all cryptocurrencies :(

Current features:
- Real-time update cryptocurrency data
- Responsive table with data about cryptocurrencies
- Ability to add cryptocurrencies of interest to the favorites table
- Validation for adding cryptocurrency to the favourite, if this coin doesn't exists on BinanceAPI or already included to favourite, a notification will warn you of an error
- Bearish/Bullish market news and how did this news affect related coins
- Market dominance widget, which shows the market percentage of the top 3 cryptocurrencies by marketcap
